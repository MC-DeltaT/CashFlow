## Disclaimer

Any use of this library to plan your finances is at your own risk! While I have tried to make the code as correct and bug-free as possible, I do not guarantee that it produces useful nor accurate results.

There is no formal versioning (yet), APIs and functionality are subject to change as I continue improving on the library.

## Tests

Tests are written in Pytest. To run:

```bash
python -m pytest
